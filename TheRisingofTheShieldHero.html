<h1>The Rising of the Shield Hero</h1>

<h3>First Look</h3>
<p class="quote">Men who sexually assault women are at a historic high point of impunity and power. Many people are fighting to change this, and awareness is a good first step, but the power structures remain mostly unscathed.</p>
     
<p>This week alone has seen two high-profile stories about sexual assault in Japan. In one, a magazine has been criticised for ranking universities by how easy it is to coax women into sex. In another, a member of idol group NMB48 has been forced to publicly apologise, twice, for being physically assaulted at her home. Outside of Japan, the United States recently swore an unapologetic rapist into their highest court, for life.</p>

<p>It is in this context that Shield Hero decides to present a story of the sheer villainy that is false rape accusation. It’s not a metaphor. It’s not subtle allusion. That is the plot here, and it’s the only plot element that differs it at all from literally every other garbage isekai show.</p>

<h3>Jel’s Verdict: Dangerous</h3>
<p class="quote">In addition to the important context that colons discussed, I’ve seen a lot of people bring up the connection between the themes of Shield Hero and the “incel” movement. I’m loathe to even use that word, if you don’t know what it is go look it up. Whether this connection is intentional or not, it’s definitely there.</p>

<p>The Shield Hero feels shunned and ostracized because he is supposedly the weakest hero, but it runs deeper than that. At one point it’s discovered the fantasy world they have arrived in is based on a real world video game. The three other heroes, confident so-called alpha males who act like jerks but are still popular anyway, all have experience playing the game. The Shield Hero does not, and after rumors spread about his lack of “knowledge of the game”, none of the hot lady warriors want to party up with him.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a stretch, but I took this as a metaphor for being a virgin, or at least an unpopular nerd. The Shield Hero is getting left out despite being the only “nice guy” and this is everyone else’s fault. Even the small amount of kindness he does receive ends up being a lie. The most damning comparison to incel ideology happens during the pivotal accusation scene. The hero says, and I quote: “Joining me was just a ruse to destroy me right here. It was all a lie! The smiles she showed me, and her acts of kindness, were all fake!”</p>
